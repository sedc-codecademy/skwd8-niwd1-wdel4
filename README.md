# Welcome to the Practical ASP.NET
Welcome to the Practical ASP.NET Subject. This is an elective subject and the main goal of it is to cover all the steps for building an ASP.NET application from end to end as we did in past subjects and finalize the process with a few new additions. This subject will focus more on building and revising and less on lectures and presentations because, as the name explains it is a practical subject, meaning the students and trainers will mostly write code. The general focus is for every student to fortify their knowledge and to go through the process of building an end to end solution again.

## Prerequisites for this Subject 🗺
1. Knowledge of C# and it's features
2. Knowledge of ASP.NET MVC Core and its features
3. Knowledge of Entity Framework Core
4. Knowledge of manipulating databases using MSSQL
5. Installed Visual Studio 2019
