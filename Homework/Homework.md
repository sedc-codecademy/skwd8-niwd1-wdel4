# Homework (Lamazon App) 👀

&nbsp;

#### For the need of the client payment process as part of the Lamazon Application you will have to implement the **Invoice** feature ❗❗❗

##### Invoice is an actual recipe that in real world application we are obligated to give to a client after successful payment. As from our perspective it should at least contain following information:

- Address
- Payment type
- and relation to the order

###### You should follow the patterns, architecture and standards that we introduced with the other features, so feel free to pull the latest changes from the repo, copy the code and start your own implementation for the _Invoice_ feature on top of the existing state of the application.

**Please note that you will have to changes vertically across the application layers meaning:**

- Changes in the `DataAccess` Layer
- Changes in the `Business` Layer
- Changes in the `Presentation` Layer

_We didn't listed all the required steps on purpose, try to figure them out yourself_ 🤓

### Before jumping into coding, we recommend taking time to think about the implementation and try to do a rough sketch (in head or on paper) about the required pieces of the implementation. If there are any unclear things please contact us for additional information (this is what we do in our everyday job as developers) 🧐

## Good luck and happy coding 🐱‍💻
